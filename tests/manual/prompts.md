# Manual Test Prompts

Use these prompts for manual smoke testing while developing MIRA.

## HITL File Write

```powershell
mira --prompt "write a file called test.txt with the content 'hello world'"
```

Expected:

- MIRA shows a `write_file` tool call.
- MIRA shows an approval prompt.
- Approving the action writes `test.txt` with `hello world`.

## Subagent Delegation

```powershell
mira --prompt "use 2 subagents. look for the readme file. after that, tell me a joke"
```

Expected:

- MIRA delegates work to two subagents.
- The subagents inspect or locate the README file.
- MIRA finishes with a joke after the README task.
